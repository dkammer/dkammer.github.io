# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  I am professor for Visual Engineering (Technische Visualistik) at the University 
  for Applied Sciences in Dresden (Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Wirtschaft Dresden). 
  My teaching and research is focused on visualization and interaction techniques and 
  technologies. During my PhD at TU Dresden, I developed a formalization for multitouch-gestures 
  based on a semiotic analysis framework. Current research is focused on 
  multidimensional visualization methods in the domain of machine learning and 
  interaction techniques for novel, elastic displays. My teaching is focused on future skills 
  and problem-solving by employing methods such as blended and project-based learning.
