Currently, both understanding and developing interactive visual interfaces become ever more challenging, since different visual solutions exist that involve large interdisciplinary teams and deal with massive amounts of data, a wide range of interaction techniques, and domain-specific aspects. At the same time, traditional design methods become obsolete with more and more resources and knowledge that needs to be acquired. The proposed workshop provides a forum for discussing experimental and theoretical techniques, frameworks, and prototyping methods to design visual interfaces in different domains such as data visualization, tangible and embedded interaction, extended and mixed reality, multi-modal interfaces, and others.
