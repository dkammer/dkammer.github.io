Tangible and Gesture-Based Interfaces are made possible by hardware like the Microsoft® Surface Device. Despite the commitment of big business, the killer application is yet to be found. To address this challenge, we investigate the innovation process. Against this background, a workshop was set up and conducted. The clarification of focuses during brainstorming is achieved by introducing a triad of innovation, which revealed potentials for entertaining multi-touch applications. We respond to these potentials with the custom-made solutions realized during our workshop.
