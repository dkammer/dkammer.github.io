This work in progress investigates gestures on tabletops with elastic displays that allow temporary deformations of the surface. While tabletops with rigid interactive surfaces have been subject of the research agenda of tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction for a considerable amount of time, we review novel systems that exploit the third dimension o ered by tabletops with elastic surfaces. In addition, we propose a tentative interaction syntax. In a user study, we compare push gestures on elastic tabletops with swipe gestures on a multi-touch display.
