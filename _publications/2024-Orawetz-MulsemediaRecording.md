Virtual environments are well-researched in the HCI community. Many approaches such Cave Automatic Virtual Environments (CAVEs) and head-mounted displays require specialized hardware and are optimized for single users. Moreover, the focus on visualization neglects other sensory input we know from the real world such as odor or spatial sound, which only recently became a more prominent feature in consumer devices. Our research is focused on recording multiple sensorial media (mulsemedia) in the real world including rich visuals, spatial sound, and odors. We describe our technology stack to record and reproduce real world places in replicable immersive environments using standard equipment where possible. Consequently, we can support more realistic training simulations or create leisure environments for relaxation.
