We report our experience in two installations of a course on data visualization that featured project-based learning. Given the rationale of this approach, we show which input was provided when necessary for the students to achieve their goals. We also discuss and compare the tools we found useful for students to accomplish their goals. Fitting project-based learning into the standard schedule of a semester at University is a particular challenge, because it is hard for students to devote longer periods of time when working on their projects. Furthermore, online learning was a challenge to effectively perform group activities and work. We address didactic considerations, our course structure, tools, and student projects. Finally, we draw conclusions on the results and improvements in the course structure.
