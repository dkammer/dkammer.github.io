Creating innovative applications for novel interface technologies poses several challenges for both designers and developers. Rapid prototyping helps to examine concepts, check hypotheses, and acquire early user feedback. In this paper, we present ReFlex, a framework that provides rapid prototyping and development tools for Elastic Displays, and its application in the context of a student project developing a spatial controller for remote 3D navigation.
