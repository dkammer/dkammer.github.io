Developing multi-touch applications is a great challenge for developers: they have to adopt a novel interaction paradigm, but lack suitable tools and reliable design guidelines. The goal of Liquid consists in introducing the concept of visual programming to multi-touch technology, implementing a promising approach to overcome the difficulties in developing applications for multi-touch devices. As a novel feature, Liquid allows the development of multi-touch applications with the help of the technology itself. This contribution illustrates the application of visual programming in the multi-touch context, presents related work, and explains the workflow of Liquid with the help of an instructive example.
