User interfaces in enterprise systems are primarily based on visualizations such as tables and forms, which are state-of-the-art since the middle of the 1990s. Additionally, most information is presented in a textual way and offers little capabilities to change the mode of presentation or the level of detail. The authors argue that these deficiencies are a major reason for existing usability problems related to the graphical user interface. Hence, this contribution presents four case studies, which aim to establish innovative visualization and interaction modalities in the field of enterprise systems.
