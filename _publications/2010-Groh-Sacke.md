Universities can play an important role in economic and technological development. In this contribution, we demonstrate how companies and universities can immediately cooperate in order to satisfy their respective business and research interests. A major trend in informatics is the starting point of our cooperation.

Multi-touch interaction is both a research topic and a part of business models. Consumer devices like Apple’s iPhone and iPad demonstrate the capabilities of this direct interaction on a small scale. In contrast, devices like Microsoft® Surface [Microsoft 2010] are larger, offering the possibility to use both hands and allowing users to work in a cooperative, intuitive, and approachable manner. These devices are currently rather expensive for state universities and customers alike. In contrast, private universities have private funds, tuition fees, and other benefactors available. To decrease the price of novel technologies, suitable concepts need to be devised in order to implement applications that exploit their potentials.

To address this challenge, we first describe funding issues, which are relevant to state universities. In the following, we discuss two education models that allow students to catalyze multi-touch topics. We address student enrollment, the necessary infrastructure, and our evaluation of the conducted educational methods.
