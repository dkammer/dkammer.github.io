Elastic Displays are shape-changing interfaces, typically made from elastic fabric. Surface deformation creates an additional dimension of interaction and enhances the haptic experience for the user compared to rigid touch interfaces. Other forms of shape-changing interfaces such as actuated displays introduce significant mechanical complexity with the benefit of providing active haptic feedback and self-deformation. We investigate ways to make Elastic Displays more `active' while maintaining their simple setup. Our approach adds vibrotactile feedback to the elastic surface, which add explicit haptic feedback when pushing and pulling the surface. In this contribution, we describe the technical setup and introduce concepts for exploiting this active haptic feedback. We realized a case study, in which a layered information space is explored. Finally, we report lessons learned from user feedback, showing that solely vibrotactile feedback may have distracting effects on the user, but in combination with visual feedback can improve the user experience.
