This paper provides a report about a framework that uses a variety of standards. Readers interested in 3D computer graphics or component-oriented technology in C++ will find a report about the integration of various standards by relying on yet another standard for component-oriented software engineering. The highly successful Java standard called Open Services Gateway initiative (OSGi) is employed in a C++ implementation called Open Service Platform. The application of this standard, which is primarily focused on network-centric software and embedded systems, in the field of real-time 3D computer graphics, provides novel insights into the usability of the OSGi standard.
