In this paper we describe DepthTouch, an installation which explores future interactive surfaces and features elastic feedback, allowing the user to go deeper than with regular multi-touch surfaces. DepthTouch's elastic display allows the user to create valleys and ascending slopes by depressing or grabbing its textile surface. We describe the experimental approach for eliciting appropriate interaction metaphors from interaction with real materials and the resulting digital prototype.
