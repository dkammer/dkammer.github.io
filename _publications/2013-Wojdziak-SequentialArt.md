A huge amount of data is produced continually in areas of application like entertainment, industry, and science. Contemporary technologies and three-dimensional computer graphics are qualified to process and to visualize this data. However, users are more and more faced with a flood of information, unable to efficiently process the information provided by three-dimensional computer graphics. Facing that problem, arrangement systems like typographic grids serve as an auxiliary layer to organize and arrange information units on a two-dimensional canvas. Due to the continually changing of interactive 3D scenes, there is no fixed order or priority of the visualized data in a projected image. Yet, in analogy to comic strips or comic books, frames that are organized in a grid can augment information visualizations. This contribution presents an approach to structure interactive 3D visualizations with the help of panels, whereby the user can recognize essential information in a given scene.
