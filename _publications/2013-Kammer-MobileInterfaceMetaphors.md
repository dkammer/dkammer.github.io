Interaction design for mobile applications is challenging due to the diversity of technologies and devices. In addition, the now ubiquitous multi-touch screens demand novel and engaging interface metaphors. In this paper, we report insights and three practical results from a workshop with undergraduate students. The aim was to experiment with new technologies by providing a set of creativity techniques for ideation. By tackling interaction design both for tablets and smartphones, flexible interface metaphors were developed.
