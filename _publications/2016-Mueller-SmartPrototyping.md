The evaluation of innovative user interface concepts using virtual reality technology faces many challenges. In this paper, we discuss current limitations regarding the integration of virtual reality in a participatory design process. Furthermore, we propose guidelines including visualization and interaction techniques that address aspects such as presence and awareness in virtual worlds.

In order to ascertain the feasibility of the proposed techniques, we present prototypical implementations.
