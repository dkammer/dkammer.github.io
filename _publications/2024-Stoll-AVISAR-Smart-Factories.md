Smart factories still require manual work by humans to remedy defects in automated production lines. Given the shortage of highly skilled workers and the demand to include people with language barriers or cognitive challenges in the workforce, novel assistance systems must be introduced to the factories. We propose an Adaptive Visual Assistance systems using Spatial Augmented Reality (AVISAR), which not only adapts to different repair tasks and the layout of a manual workplace in the factory, but also to the individual human skills and needs. This should result in a more inclusive work environment and the well-being of a more diverse workforce. Spatial AR promises to be a more accessible approach than head-mounted displays. In this contribution, we present the conceptual framework and a first working prototype of the AVISAR system.
