This article presents a learning portfolio written during the Basic Teaching Qualification in Higher Education at the Centre for Teaching and Learning in Higher Education Saxony (HDS). This document provides insights into my personal learning process and contains reflections on my teaching practice and how it was influenced by attending various didactics-related courses of the HDS. Hence, it is a compilation of material and information from these courses as well as of results of exercises. My individual comments and insights show how I adapted, inter-connected, and applied the contents and experiences of these courses to my teaching. I also discuss challenges in applying some guidelines and ideas for future application of didactic methods and theories
