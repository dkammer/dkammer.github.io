Any design endeavor requires practitioners to engage in divergent thinking (cp. Double Diamond Model). Numerous creativity techniques and methods exist to support the design process and give structure in order to converge a wide variety of ideas into suitable candidates for prototyping and testing. Designing for specific, tangible interaction technologies requires a careful framing of the selected methods. Over the course of 10 years, our research group has gained experience in designing and developing applications for elastic displays. In this pictorial paper, we illustrate methods and intermediate results for a concrete application design. Due to the Covid19 pandemic, we made extensive use of the collaborative whiteboard application miro. We designed a way to visualize, explore, and evaluate clustering algorithms in the domain of machine learning using an elastic display. Finally, we present follow- up techniques for prototyping the concepts and ideas.
