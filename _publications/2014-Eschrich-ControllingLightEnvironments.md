    abstract="In this paper, we describe a software interface for controlling light environments using segmented light sources based on OLED arrays. We propose requirements for a tool that can be used to author specific light scenarios. Both the technical view and the user view on the system are addressed. We describe the concept of creating such an interface and demonstrate an example for a specific light source. The light source consists of 72 OLED segments that can be individually programmed using a mobile device. Different use cases illustrate the concepts. The description of future work regarding the control of OLED lighting situations concludes the paper.",
