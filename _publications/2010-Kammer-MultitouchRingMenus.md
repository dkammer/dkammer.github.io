In the future, environments equipped with interaction surfaces sensitive to touch input will be a key factor to enable ambient intelligence. The userâ€™s fingers become input devices, allowing simple and intuitive interaction, like the manipulation of digital objects. However, people are used to everyday applications offering a wide variety of menu choices. We evaluate ring menus to enhance the expressiveness of finger interaction on multi-touch devices. Applicability and limits of ring menus are discussed with regard to our implementation by means of a preliminary user study.
