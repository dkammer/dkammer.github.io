The field of Visual Analytics attempts to identify phenomena, guidelines, and algorithms to generate images suitable to communicate information efficiently and effectively. The benefit of using information visualizations is that the represented data can be quickly perceived and comprehended by the viewer. Research of novel visualization and interaction techniques in the context of three-dimensional computer graphics requires interactive computer systems. To this end, a component-oriented software framework is presented in this contribution. Bildsprache LiveLab (BiLL) allows independent implementation and combination of different components. Each component is responsible for various tasks in the context of investigating images of three-dimensional scenes. Two case studies covering multiperspective and color perspective illustrate the application of BiLL and its potential as an experimental environment for visualizing user-centered projections of three-dimensional scenes.
