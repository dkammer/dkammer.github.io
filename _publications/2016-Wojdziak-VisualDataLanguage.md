Data volume is increasing steadily. Visualization helps to handle not only the volume, but the ever increasing diversity of data. Visualization gives answers faster and reveals information that would go unnoticed and therefore unused in decision making. The challenge we address in this contribution is how visualizations can be created semi-automatic without taking the individual human-centered view of the designer on an interface out of the loop. In this paper, we present a tool-supported design process to develop aesthetic and interactive data visualizations in a conceptual, guided, effective way.
