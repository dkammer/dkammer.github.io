Aesthetic pleasure in viewing information visualizations can profoundly influence how the displayed data is perceived and memorized. Several instruments to measure aesthetics for visual communication have been proposed, but the influence of interaction with a visual display has not yet been investigated. In a user study, we explore how interaction with displayed data reflects on three measurement tools for aesthetics: a single slider, the BeauVis questionnaire, and the Aesthetic Pleasure in Design Scale. We could detect that specific items of the BeauVis scale (pleasing, appealing, likeable) are significantly influenced by whether users interacted with the presented static or interactive diagrams.
