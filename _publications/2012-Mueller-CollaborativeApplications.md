Multi-touch devices and gesture tracking have recently been established as tools for collaborative interactive spaces. Innovative application concepts and applicable scenarios in which gesture-based interaction has advantages instead of traditional WIMP User Interfaces are necessary. In this article, the results of a series of workshops conducted during the last three years are presented. These workshops focused on the creation of innovative multi-touch applications in the domain of tabletop devices. Furthermore, important lessons learned from the setup of these workshops and the arising didactic approaches including their benefits and drawbacks are described.
