Shape-changinginterfaces are addressed by theresearch community with more scientific vigor in recent years. Elastic displays afford novel ways to interact with data and have also been investigated for almost a decade now. Our goal is to move this interaction technology out of its experimental stage and into more sophisticated real-world scenarios. In this work-in-progress paper, we describe our research agenda and preliminary results. On the one hand, we aim to consolidate and extend fundamental knowledge about the interaction and visualization techniques that are suitable and effective for elastic displays. Our main goals in this respect are the development and evaluation of a gesture language and the introduction of an online knowledge base. On the other hand, we investigate specific use cases that leverage the unique properties of elastic displays. For this leg of our research, we carry out a long-term observation of a museum installation of an elastic display and devise new applications in a research project with industrial partners.
