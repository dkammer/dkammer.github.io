This position paper describes our view on the current state of research in the domain of elastic displays. Elastic displays exhibit a number of unique properties: they enable varied haptic feedback, maintain consistency of shape, and afford natural physics. The main contribution of this paper is a systematic review of current technological and conceptual issues for enabling elastic displays. We discuss shortcomings that hamper a readily adoption of elastic displays and propose three directions for future research: elastic gestures, hooks, and gravibles.
