Novel shape-changing interfaces promise to provide a rich haptic experience for human-computer interaction. As a specific instance of shape-changing interfaces, Elastic Displays provide large interaction surfaces that can be temporally deformed using force-touch. The unique property of these displays is that they automatically return to their initial flat state. Recently, several review and position papers have stimulated a discussion towards consolidating the knowledge about shape-changing interfaces. The knowledge about Elastic Displays is similarly scattered across multiple publications from recent years. This paper contributes a task taxonomy based on productive uses of Elastic Displays found in literature, on the web, and in our interaction lab. This taxonomy emphasizes tasks, but also encompasses general aspects regarding content types, visualization technology, and interaction styles. All aspects of the taxonomy are illustrated using case studies from literature.
