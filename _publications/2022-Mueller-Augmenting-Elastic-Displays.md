Within the last years, several use-cases for Elastic Displays have been explored, showing the potential for this novel technology. However, one of the shortcomings of this type of interface is that it is not possible to provide active haptic feedback to the user. This feature is limited to actuated displays, which in turn are much more complex to build, more expensive, less robust and portable. In this paper, we describe another approach to provide basic active haptic feedback for Elastic Displays by using vibration motors. We explore different options for vibrotactile feedback and describe the results of a student project in which some of the concepts were realized as part of a small game prototype.
