The article deals with multiple skill barriers in digitalised industrial work environments. Overcoming them could help to reduce shortage of skilled workers in the manufacturing sector in Germany. An empirical study aims to develop and evaluate suitable qualification tools and measures for the integration of people with skills barriers such as illiteracy, language barriers and lack of familiarity with digital technologies (digital immigrants) into industrial work processes.
