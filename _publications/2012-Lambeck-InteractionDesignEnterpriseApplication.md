In Enterprise Information Systems, users are facing complex user interfaces with a multitude of functionalities. These interfaces still rely on the WIMP-paradigm including forms, tables and dashboards, which are meant to be used with mouse and keyboard. This contribution argues that there is a gap between the increased process complexity and the traditional concepts in visualization and interaction. In this paper, an exemplary scenario addresses these challenges by exploiting tangible interaction on a tabletop system.
