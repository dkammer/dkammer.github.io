Gestural interfaces have been the subject of research in the HCI community for a long time. In contrast to existing examples of multimodal interfaces, which combine freehand gestures with speech, this paper proposes the combination of both touch and point gestures. Touch requires users to actually initiate contact with the interaction surface, whereas point interaction allows them to use hand movements in the proximity of the user interface. Formalization is deemed necessary to subsequently combine the two gestural interaction styles to realize engineering patterns for multi-touch interfaces. A prototype is presented, showing the potential of combined touch and point interaction in map navigation.
