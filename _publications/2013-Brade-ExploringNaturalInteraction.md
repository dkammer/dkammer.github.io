Designers are often challenged to break free from the traditional interaction design for mouse and keyboard to create new and compelling user experiences for natural user interfaces. We conducted several workshops to inspire and provoke critical reflection on interaction and interface design for natural user interfaces based on physical substances that are used in everyday life [2, 3, 5]. The method used in these workshops has been developed as a hands-on alternative to the usual way of focusing on problems and solutions first in order to create new interfaces. We employ a playful experimental approach to generate ideas regarding visualization and interaction. In this paper, we detail our proposed method for exploring natural interaction and provide three examples from our previous workshops.
