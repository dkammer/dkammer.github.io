description: >-
    In this project, we establish a laboratory environment for immersive, multimodal experiences. The laboratory is installed in a standard office container to enable an easy transportation or reproduction of similar environments. Communication within the container is supported by a 3D audio system, a three-sided projection system, haptic devices, ambient lighting, and tracking technologies. The aim is to create diverse atmospheres to modulate experiences. Application scenarios range from remote collaboration to training scenarios.
